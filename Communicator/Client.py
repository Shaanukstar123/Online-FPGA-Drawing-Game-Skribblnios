"""HOW IT WORKS:
The client connects to the server and the first command it sends is a setname command,
current randomly generated

A thread begins to always listen for data from the server

Data is processed by the processData method, current just printing the data to console.

Sending !DISCONNECT will disconnect the current client, and will no longer have responses from the server

command examples:

x -> Server Response: x
!DISCONNECT -> diconnects player
SERVERCMD: !BROADCAST x -> sends message x to all currently connected players
